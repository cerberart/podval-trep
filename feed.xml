    <description>Serial is a new podcast from the creators of This American Life,
    hosted by Sarah Koenig. Serial unfolds one story - a true story - over the course of a whole
    season. The show follows the plot and characters wherever they lead, through many surprising
    twists and turns. Sarah won't know what happens at the end of the story until she gets there, not
    long before you get there with her. Each week she'll bring you the latest chapter, so it's
    important to listen in, starting with Episode 1. New episodes are released on Thursday
    mornings. Serial, like This American Life, is a production of WBEZ Chicago.

    <title>Episode 09: To Be Suspected</title>
    <description>New information is coming in about what maybe did not happen on
    January 13, 1999. And while the memory of that day is foggy at best, he does remember what
    happened next: being questioned, being arrested and, a little more than a year later, being
    sentenced to life in prison.</description>
